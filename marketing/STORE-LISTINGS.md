### Description

```
Shortkeys lets you create custom keyboard shortcuts for anything your browser can do. Choose from 120+ built-in actions, chain them into macros, or write your own JavaScript — all with a clean, modern interface.

WHAT CAN IT DO?

Shortkeys ships with 120+ built-in actions across 11 categories:

- Scrolling: scroll up/down/left/right, jump to top or bottom
- Tabs: open, close, pin, mute, move, sort, duplicate, suspend, group, and switch tabs
- Navigation: back, forward, reload, copy URL, open from clipboard
- Windows: new window, new private window, close window, fullscreen
- Bookmarks: open any bookmark or bookmarklet with a shortcut
- Zooming: zoom in, zoom out, reset
- Video controls: play/pause, speed up/down, skip, mute, fullscreen
- Search: search Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, or GitHub for selected text
- Page tools: cheat sheet overlay, toggle dark mode on any page
- Page scripts: 25 ready-to-use scripts (highlight links, remove images, extract emails, and more)
- Miscellaneous: run custom JavaScript, insert text, trigger other shortcuts, take screenshots, print, and more

MACROS — CHAIN MULTIPLE ACTIONS

Chain up to 10 actions into a single shortcut with optional delays between steps. Example: press one key to open a new tab, navigate to a URL, and pin it.

SHORTCUT PACKS — ONE-CLICK PRESETS

Get started fast with 9 curated shortcut packs:

- Vim Navigation — browse the web with hjkl
- Emacs Navigation — Emacs-style movement and editing
- YouTube Power User — speed controls, skip, fullscreen
- Productivity — tab management and navigation essentials
- Developer Tools — view source, console, clear cache
- Speed Reading — scroll, font size, reading mode
- Tab Manager — advanced tab switching and organization
- Keyboard Power User — power user essentials
- Media Control — universal play/pause, skip, volume

COMMAND PALETTE

Click the Shortkeys icon (or set a global shortcut) to open a searchable command palette. Search and trigger any of your shortcuts instantly, or add a new one without opening settings.

MORE FEATURES

- Cloud sync: shortcuts sync across devices via Chrome Sync, with automatic local fallback if your data exceeds the sync quota
- Groups: organize shortcuts into collapsible, renamable groups with bulk enable/disable
- Per-site filtering: set any shortcut to work on all sites, all sites except specific ones, or only on specific sites
- Shortcut recorder: click Record and press your keys — supports multi-key sequences (like "g i" for Gmail-style shortcuts)
- Conflict detection: warns you when a shortcut conflicts with a browser default (platform-aware for Mac vs Windows/Linux)
- Shareable links: generate a URL to share individual shortcuts or entire groups with anyone
- Custom JavaScript: full code editor with syntax highlighting, Greasyfork/userscript import, and a Test button to run scripts in any tab
- Live reload: saved shortcuts update in all open tabs instantly — no page refresh needed
- Dark mode: follows your system preference
- Undo/redo: made a mistake in settings? Ctrl+Z to undo
- Guided onboarding: new users get a step-by-step wizard
- Usage analytics: see which shortcuts you use most (local only, never shared)

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

Use any combination of modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Cmd/Meta) with letters, numbers, punctuation, or special keys (F1-F19, arrows, Home, End, Page Up/Down, etc.). String multiple combos together for key sequences like "g i" or "ctrl+k ctrl+c".

## Microsoft Edge Add-ons

> Plain text. Specs not well-documented — follow Chrome format to be safe.

### Description

Use the same copy as the [Chrome Web Store description](#chrome-web-store) above. Edge Add-ons uses plain text and similar formatting constraints.

Note: Some Chrome-specific features may need adjustment for Edge (e.g., "Chrome Sync" → "browser sync"). Tab grouping (`chrome.tabs.group`) is supported in Edge.

---

## Screenshot Plan

> All screenshots should be **1280×800 pixels**, JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no transparency). 16:10 aspect ratio. Chrome allows up to 5.

### How to Capture

Use the `npm run visual-review` script to build and launch the extension headlessly, then capture screenshots. Or load the built extension manually in Chrome and use a full-page screenshot tool at exactly 1280×800 viewport.

For the best results:
- Use a clean Chrome profile (no other extensions in toolbar)
- Use a 1280×800 viewport (or 2560×1600 for 2x retina, then downscale)
- Populate with realistic shortcut data (not "test" or "asdf")
- Light mode for screenshots 1-4, dark mode for screenshot 5

### Slot 1: Options Page — Groups & Shortcuts

**What to show:** The main options page with 2-3 groups expanded, showing 5-7 realistic shortcuts (e.g., "Vim Navigation" group with hjkl scrolling, a "Tab Management" group with next/previous tab shortcuts). The search bar and stats bar should be visible at the top.

**Why:** First impression. Shows the clean, modern v5 UI with groups, toggle switches, and the overall layout.

**Setup:**
- Import the Vim and Productivity packs
- Expand both groups
- Ensure the stats bar shows "X shortcuts" and the search field is visible
- Light mode

### Slot 2: Command Palette

**What to show:** The popup command palette with a search query partially typed (e.g., "new") showing filtered results like "New tab", "New window", "New private window". The Quick Add form should not be open — show the search/trigger mode.

**Why:** The command palette is a unique differentiator. Most shortcut extensions don't have one.

**Setup:**
- Have 8-10 shortcuts configured
- Open the popup
- Type "new" in the search field
- Screenshot the popup at its natural size, centered on a neutral background page

### Slot 3: Macros / Chaining

**What to show:** A macro shortcut expanded, showing 3-4 chained actions (e.g., "Morning routine" → New tab → Navigate to URL → Pin tab). The delay fields and step controls should be visible.

**Why:** Macros are a powerful v5 feature that competitors don't have.

**Setup:**
- Create a "Macros" group
- Add a "Morning routine" shortcut with macro steps
- Expand it to show the step list
- Light mode

### Slot 4: Import — Shortcut Packs

**What to show:** The Import tab with the shortcut pack browser visible, showing the grid of 9 pack cards (Vim, Emacs, YouTube, etc.) with their icons, names, and descriptions.

**Why:** Packs make Shortkeys instantly useful for new users. Great "wow, there's a lot here" moment.

**Setup:**
- Click the "Import" tab
- Scroll to the pack browser section
- Ensure all 9 pack cards are visible in the grid
- Light mode

### Slot 5: Dark Mode

**What to show:** The options page in dark mode with 2-3 groups of shortcuts visible. Similar content to Slot 1 but in dark theme.

**Why:** Dark mode is table stakes but still worth showing — it signals a polished, modern extension.

**Setup:**
- Same shortcut data as Slot 1
- Toggle to dark mode
- Screenshot

### Firefox & Edge Notes

- Use the same 5 screenshots for all stores
- Firefox has no strict dimension requirement but 1280×800 works well
- Edge likely follows Chrome's specs
