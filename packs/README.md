## Contributing a Community Pack

Want to share your shortcuts with other Shortkeys users? Submit a pull request!

### Pack Format

Create a JSON file in `packs/community/` with this format:

```json
{
  "name": "My Pack Name",
  "icon": "🎯",
  "description": "One or two sentences about what this pack does.",
  "author": "your-github-username",
  "shortcuts": [
    { "key": "alt+shift+f", "action": "onlytab", "label": "Close all other tabs" },
    { "key": "alt+shift+m", "action": "togglemute", "label": "Mute/unmute current tab" }
  ]
}
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Display name for the pack |
| `icon` | A single emoji |
| `description` | 1-2 sentences about what the pack does |
| `author` | Your GitHub username |
| `shortcuts` | Array of shortcut objects with `key`, `action`, and `label` |

You don't need to provide `id`, `color`, `category`, or `tags` — these are auto-generated by the build system.

### Shortcut Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | Yes | Key binding (e.g. `alt+shift+f`, `ctrl+k`) |
| `action` | Yes | Action name from the [action registry](../src/utils/actions-registry.ts) |
| `label` | Yes | Human-readable label (sentence case) |
| `code` | Only for `javascript` actions | JavaScript code to execute |

### Guidelines

- **Labels use sentence case**: "Close all other tabs" not "Close All Other Tabs"
- **Don't duplicate built-in packs** or shortcuts that websites already provide (Gmail, GitHub, etc.)
- **Test all shortcuts** in your pack before submitting
- **JavaScript actions** are allowed but will show a security warning to users
- **File name** should be lowercase with hyphens: `my-pack-name.json`

### How to Submit

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your pack JSON file in `packs/community/`
3. Run `npm test` to validate your pack
4. Submit a pull request

Or use the quick method: In Shortkeys, right-click a group → "Publish to community" to auto-generate the JSON and open a GitHub issue.

## Official Packs

Official packs in `packs/official/` are maintained by the Shortkeys team. They include additional fields (`id`, `color`) that are managed by the team. To suggest changes to official packs, open an issue.
